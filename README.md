### Tools Required

Depending on whether your task is code or media oriented, you will need some combination of the following tools to develop Langenium:

* Text editor or an IDE
* Command line interface with Node.js
* 3D modelling program
* Bitmap and vector image editors
* Digital Audio Workstation

All of the above can be accomplished with Free and Open Source Software, but there are also commercial options that some people prefer.

* Client
    1. Change directory to /client
    2. Install npm packages
    3. Run either `npm run build` to compile once or `npm run dev` to compile, start a web server and watch for changes.
